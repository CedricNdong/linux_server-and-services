# linux_server-and-services

Linux is a powerful system that can offer all kinds of services: DNS infrastructure management, DHCP, NTP, etc., mail and communication servers, instant messaging, telephony, videoconferencing, etc., authentication services, databases, and of course web services.

# In the first part of the course, we will discover how to manage server services with systemd, but also how to configure a time server, install and manage an LDAP directory.

#In the second part, we will install and secure a LAMP server step by step.

#Finally, in the third part, we will see how to manage a complex infrastructure using Tomcat & Jenkins, and setting up a reverse-proxy and a proxy-cache.
